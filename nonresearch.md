# Beyond research

Life in academia can sometimes be challenging, particularly for juniors. One thing that helps us stay calm and move forward is doing research we are passionate about (or at least have some faith in), hopefully. Because there will be unexpected negative things (more than what a tough reviewer 2 would bring), passion will help us survive. 


Additionally, appreciating the beauty in life works for me. I occasionally update the things that bring me happiness here. 🍧	🎂 	🍰
