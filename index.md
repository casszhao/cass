## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatar.jpg">

I am Cass Zhixue Zhao, a lecturer (Assistant Professor) in [Natural Language Processing](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) at the Computer Science Department of the University of Sheffield. My long-term research goal is to enable trustworthy, responsible, and efficient NLP models. These days, I am interested in anything related to **interpretability** and **large language models** (LLMs). My recent research projects focus on **model compression**, **model editing**, and **text-to-image models**. Previously, I served as co-Principal Investigator on the [ExU](https://exuproject.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/) project, developing multilingual AI tools to support journalists and fact-checkers in identifying disinformation narratives.

Previously, I worked as a Postdoc researcher on explainable AI and responsible AI. The overarching aim is to demystify predictions made by black-box LLMs, making them easier to understand and trustworthy. The work also addresses model hallucination to ensure the reliability of LLMs, alongside exploring model compression techniques that mitigate compute demands and thus foster inclusivity within NLP research. Back in 2020, I worked as a research assistant within the same department, working on NIHR-funded NLP projects for systematic reviews of public health research. My Ph.D. research, funded by the University of Sheffield, examined transfer learning and mitigating model bias in hate speech detection.
