## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatar.jpg">

I am Cass Zhixue Zhao, a lecturer in [Natural Language Processing](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) at the Computer Science Department of the University of Sheffield. My long-term research goal is to enable trustworthy, responsible, and efficient NLP models. These days, I am interested in anything related to **interpretability** and **large language models** (LLMs). My recent research projects focus on **model compression**, **model editing**, and **text-to-image models**.

Previously, I worked as a Postdoc researcher on explainable AI and responsible AI. The overarching aim is to demystify predictions made by black-box LLMs, making them easier to understand and trustworthy. The work also addresses model hallucination to ensure the reliability of LLMs, alongside exploring model compression techniques that mitigate compute demands and thus foster inclusivity within NLP research. Back in 2020, I worked as a research assistant within the same department, working on NIHR-funded NLP projects for systematic reviews of public health research. My Ph.D. research, which was funded by the University of Sheffield, looked at transfer learning and mitigating model bias for hate speech detection.
