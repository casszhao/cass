## Specific and Interesting Research Directions in LLM Red Teaming

**1. Automated Red Teaming and Adversarial Prompt Generation**

- Developing LLM-driven or reinforcement learning-based systems to automatically generate diverse and effective adversarial prompts that elicit harmful or unsafe outputs from target models[^6].
- Exploring black-box and curiosity-driven exploration strategies to maximize coverage and discover novel vulnerabilities, such as mode collapse in RL-based attacks or semantic diversity in prompts[^6].
- Leveraging GFlowNet fine-tuning, smoothing phases, or deep adversarial interaction frameworks (e.g., DART) for iterative, scalable vulnerability discovery[^6][^7].

**2. Multimodal Red Teaming**

- Extending red teaming beyond text to vision-language models (VLMs), testing for vulnerabilities when LLMs process images, audio, or other modalities[^7].
- Creating specialized datasets and evaluation frameworks for multimodal faithfulness, privacy, safety, and fairness[^7].

**3. Domain-Specific and Contextual Red Teaming**

- Designing red teaming exercises tailored to sensitive domains such as healthcare, law, or finance, where LLM outputs can have high-stakes consequences (e.g., clinical decision support, legal advice)[^7].
- Incorporating domain experts (e.g., child safety, suicide prevention, hate speech specialists) to craft contextually relevant and culturally nuanced attack prompts, including in multiple languages and dialects[^2][^7].

**4. Jailbreaking and Prompt Injection Research**

- Systematically cataloging and evolving jailbreak techniques (e.g., reframing requests, multi-turn attacks, or exploiting system message weaknesses) to bypass safety guardrails[^1][^6].
- Investigating the effectiveness of prompt injection attacks in various deployment contexts, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and autonomous agents[^1][^4].

**5. Privacy and Data Leakage Testing**

- Probing for unintentional leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) or proprietary data, especially in models trained on mixed or sensitive datasets[^1][^7].
- Red teaming for indirect leakage via model memorization, output formatting, or inference-time vulnerabilities[^1].

**6. Bias, Fairness, and Stereotype Propagation**

- Evaluating LLM responses for subtle and overt biases, discrimination, or stereotype reinforcement, particularly across different demographic groups or under adversarial framing[^1][^7].
- Building comprehensive red teaming datasets and metrics for fairness evaluation, including intersectional and cross-lingual scenarios[^2][^7].

**7. Robustness and Consistency Under Adversarial Perturbations**

- Testing LLMs’ ability to maintain safety, factuality, and formatting under slight prompt changes, paraphrasing, or adversarial context switching[^1][^6].
- Developing fuzzing-inspired frameworks (e.g., GPTFuzzer) to automate the discovery of robustness failures[^7].

**8. Realistic Attack Simulations and Adversary Emulation**

- Emulating advanced persistent threats (APTs) and real-world attacker tactics, such as RAG poisoning, lateral movement, and privilege escalation within LLM-powered systems[^4].
- Conducting full-simulation and assumed-breach exercises to test end-to-end system resilience, including infrastructure and access control vulnerabilities[^4].

**9. Scaling and Standardizing Red Teaming Methodologies**

- Researching how to scale red teaming efforts using automation, crowdsourcing, and diverse expert involvement while maintaining quality and coverage[^2][^3][^5].
- Developing standardized benchmarks, reporting protocols, and best practices for LLM red teaming across organizations and regulatory environments[^5][^4].

**10. Human Factors and Team Diversity in Red Teaming**

- Studying the impact of team composition—diversity in expertise, background, and lived experience—on the effectiveness and creativity of red teaming outcomes[^2][^8].
- Investigating collaborative and “alchemist mindset” approaches for boundary-pushing, playful, and creative exploration of LLM vulnerabilities[^5][^8].
